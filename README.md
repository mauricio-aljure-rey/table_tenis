# Welcome!

table_tenis is a repository where the code for a table tennis machine is kept. The table tennis machine was made by me from scratch: pcb design, mechanics design, component selection, manufacturing, etc. Arduino was used to control the motors (3 for speed and spin control, 1 for lifting up the balls on the net), led indicators, buttons and other control. Currently under construction.
